Hi

I have 10 years of experience worked with a variety of companies including small startups and big communities, which made me intimately familiar with all the stages of the web lifecycle from the initial architecture to final deployment. 

I have extensive knowledge of front-end JavaScript as well as significant experience with popular frameworks and libraries like React/Redux, Angular, and Vue. My deep full-stack experience includes Node.js/Express.js and Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Redis as well as more traditional technologies like PHP, and MySQL. Recently, I have worked on several cryptocurrency projects piling up great knowledge on Blockchain tech.

I am not new to the remote freelancing scene, so I am extremely flexible with any working hours.
I guarantee 100% customized solutions for your project.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
Lucas Fu
