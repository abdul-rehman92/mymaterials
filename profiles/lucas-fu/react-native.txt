Hi

I have 10 years of experience worked with a variety of companies including small startups and big communities, which made me intimately familiar with all the stages of the web lifecycle from the initial architecture to final deployment. 

I have extensive knowledge of React.js as well as React Native.
Please check my previous project.

I am not new to the remote freelancing scene, so I am extremely flexible with any working hours.
I guarantee 100% customized solutions for your project.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
Lucas Fu
